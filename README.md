# ButterOff

ButterOff is a way to help people be better off by not throwing away food or household items. If you have more butter than you need because you bought a 10kg. pack at some large box store, add it here, share, and help others be ButterOff!

## Installation

Fork and clone repository.

Run 'bundle install' while in directory.

And then execute:

Or install it yourself as:

## Usage

This is a simple sinatra MVC webapp to provide a place to share common household goods.
